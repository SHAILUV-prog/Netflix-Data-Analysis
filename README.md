# Netflix Data Analysis

This is one of my early Data Science projects where I explored the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset to understand the type of content available on Netflix, how the platform has grown over the years, and the trends that can be observed.

The main goal of this project was to practice real-world data analysis using Python, work with a large dataset, create meaningful visualizations, and derive insights instead of just writing code.

## Project Objectives

- Compare Movies vs TV Shows on Netflix
- Analyze how Netflix’s content library has grown over the years
- Identify top content-contributing countries
- Explore the most common genres
- Analyze ratings to understand Netflix’s target audience

## Dataset Information

This project uses the “Netflix Movies and TV Shows” dataset from Kaggle.

The dataset contains information such as:
- Title
- Director
- Cast
- Country
- Release year
- Rating
- Duration
- Genre

## Tools and Technologies

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Methodology

1. Loaded and explored the dataset
2. Cleaned missing and inconsistent values
3. Extracted additional features such as year added
4. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5. Created meaningful visualizations
6. Derived insights from the analysis

## Key Insights

- Netflix has more Movies than TV Shows
- Content additions increased significantly after 2015
- The USA and India are among the top content contributors
- Drama, International Movies, and Documentaries are the most common genres
- Most content is rated TV-MA or TV-14, indicating a focus on teens and adults
- Netflix has shifted from being US-centric to a global streaming platform

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone <>
   cd <repo-folder>

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install required dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

4. Run the analysis notebook or script
